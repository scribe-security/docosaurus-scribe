An SBOM can be utilized for identifying vulnerabilities inherited from dependencies, during both the development phase and the use phase. It can also be used to identify open-source dependencies with low reputation. Today, organizations are not always aware of the full extent of the open-source dependencies in the software they build or use. Moreover, if such information exists, it is not methodically tracked or communicated to the stakeholders who consume this software. This is especially true in vendor-customer relationships."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"Read more on SBOM ",(0,o.kt)("a",{href:"https://scribesecurity.com/sbom/"},"here"),"."),(0,o.kt)("h3",{id:"integrity-validation-and-open-source-authentication"},"Integrity Validation and Open Source Authentication"),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"Scribe validates the integrity of your software build by tracking every file\u2019s hash value from the file\u2019s origin to the built artifact, throughout the software development lifecycle. This origin can be open-source or internal: a code repo, a package manager or a container registry. In the process, Scribe flags suspicious modifications while accounting for legitimate changes such as linting and compilation. Scribe also validates the build environment and tools in a similar way. With its open-source package intelligence service, Scribe authenticates the open-source components, thus assuring that they were not maliciously modified. Scribe enriches SBOMs with this granular validation information and you can share it with relevant stakeholders.\nAdvanced user can cryptographically sign and validate critical evidence with customer keys, throughout the software development lifecycle (SDLC).
