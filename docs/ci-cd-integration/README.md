# CI/CD Integration

Now that you have tried our tool manually on a repository and received the integrity report here's a way for you to automate the process.
Scribe allows you to integrate our *SBOM* creation tool and our report directly into your pipeline. Below are two suggested integrations, using <a href='/docosaurus-scribe/docs/ci-cd-integration/github-actions'>GitHub actions</a> and <a href='/docosaurus-scribe/docs/ci-cd-integration/jenkins'>Jenkins over Kubernetes</a>.
